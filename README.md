PokÉxplore is just a fun side project to trick my son into hanging out with me.

Another reason I built it was so I could get my hands dirty with the latest Next.js upgrades like [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes), [React Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#server-components), and default [server-side data fetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/patterns).
